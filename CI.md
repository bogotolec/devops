# Best practices on CI/CD

1. CI/CD is all about automatization, so there is need to automate building and deployment.
2. Optimization, build/deploy/everything else should be as fast as we can do it. For this, we can use caches, for example.
3. Automate testing, so we can know if there are some problems in the application ans is there a sence to build this.
4. Last build and commit should be easy to access and get.

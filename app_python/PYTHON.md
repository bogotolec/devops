# TL;DR

Simplest http server that shows current time, nothing special.

## Framework

Since this application is extremely simple to design, I decided to use default python libraries `http.server` for serving content, and `datetime` for recieving information about current time.

## Code style

For this project I have used default python code style [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with four spaces for indentation.

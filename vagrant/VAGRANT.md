# Vargrant

Desspite the fact that task says to use Terraform, I decided to use the Vagrant instead.

Newer versions of Terraform for Windows have a bug which I could not to fix, so instead of finding older versions of Terraform I decided to use Vagrant.

# Google cloud

As provider I decided to use Google cloud for several reasons:

* I already have an experience in AWS from previous courses.
* I am banned in AWS, so I had to create new fake account.
* Google cloud provides free usage of services for equivalent of 300 dollars, so it is harder to mess up.

# Best practices

* Configure security
* With multiple runs, result of execution of the script should stay the same.
